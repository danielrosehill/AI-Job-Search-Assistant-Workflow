## The Motivation For This Project

Initiating and managing job searches has to be one of the most stressful things that grown-ups need to do throughout the course of their working lives. For years I have wondered if there could be a better way of job-hunting that made the entire process less oppositional for both parties. Do the laws of the universe decree that job-hunting must be tedious and awful?!

I believe that it's not a stretch to argue that our curent model of job-hunting is fundamentally broken. With some exceptions, the job hunt process of 2025 is characterised by a stark inbalance of power between prospective employees and prospective hiring parties. 

Too often, market forces dictate that employees approach the job hunt from a weak bargaining position: they *need* to find a new opportunity to make ends meet. But on the other side of the pictuer (that of hirers) the system is often just as thankless: they might need people with skills, but struggle to conceive of human capital in its fullest expression - that of people.

The mutually disliked meeting place where these two groups - the marketplace for the supply of labor - are jobs "boards." While these have gotten somewhat better over time, they still ultimately reflect a needs-based vantage point for each party. 

The migration towards remote work has arguably made the need for a better form of recruitment more pressing. If the pool of potential applicants for a job is potentially global (and vast), then the sludge of poor-fit applications bogging down the time of HR is potentially far greater. Add AI-assisted auto-applying on the other side fo the equation and the system could reach a breaking point of non-functionality. This doesn't create a better job hunting system. It creates the same broken job hunting system, but put on steroids. 

## The idea for this AI workflow

The job hunting platform that I've long wished existed is something very different: 

- Rather than asking applicants for keywords (companies, job titles) forcing them to artificially constrain their vision of best employment into an arbitrary number of words, This job hunting platform would provide them with an extensive canvas board upon which to flesh out their ideal vision of employment. 

- On the other side of the platform, the same process could be modelled by companies: Instead of the normative process for hiring being asking HR departments to draft repetitive job specifications setting out their labor needs, employees were asked to think more deeply about what kind of team members would best align with their values and mission.

In short: If we could get both parties of the equation to shift their thinking from what they think they can "get" in the market to what they ideal situation would be, a matching
